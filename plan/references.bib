  abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a
redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent
hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully
considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine
meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

Observations of hydrogen and helium radio recombination lines between 8 and 10 GHz were made toward the peak radio continuum position in S206. We derive 4He/H=0.08459+/-0.00088 (random)+/-0.0010 (known systematic), 20\% lower than optical recombination line results. It is difficult to reconcile the large discrepancy between the optical and radio values even when accounting for temperature, density, and
ionization structure or for optical extinction by dust. Using only M17 and S206 we determine {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z=1.41+/-0.62 in the Galaxy,
consistent with standard chemical evolution models. High helium
abundances in the old stellar population of elliptical galaxies can help explain the increase in UV emission with shorter wavelength between 2000 and 1200 {\AA}, called the ``UV upturn'' or UVX. Our lower values of {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z are consistent with a normal helium abundance at
higher metallicity and suggest that other factors, such as a variable red giant branch mass loss with metallicity, may be important. When combined with 4He abundances in metal-poor galaxy H II regions, Magellanic Cloud H II regions, and M17 that have been
determined from optical recombination lines, including the effects of temperature fluctuations, our radio 4He/H abundance ratio for S206 is consistent with a helium evolution of {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z=1.6. A
linear extrapolation to zero metallicity predicts a 4He/H primordial abundance ratio about 5\% lower than that given by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and standard big bang
nucleosynthesis. The measured 4He abundances may be
systematically underestimated by a few percent if clumping exists in these H II regions.},

We report revised radii of 177,911 Kepler stars derived by combining parallaxes from the Gaia Data Release 2 with the DR25 Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog. The median radius precision is {$\approx$}8\%, a typical improvement by a factor of 4\textendash{}5 over previous estimates for typical Kepler stars. We find that {$\approx$}67\% ({$\approx$}120,000) of all Kepler targets are main-sequence stars, {$\approx$}21\% ({$\approx$}37,000) are subgiants, and {$\approx$}12\% ({$\approx$}21,000) are red giants, demonstrating that subgiant contamination is less severe than some previous estimates and that Kepler targets are mostly main-sequence stars. Using the revised stellar radii, we recalculate the radii for 2123 confirmed and 1922 candidate exoplanets. We confirm the presence of a gap in the radius distribution of small, close-in planets, but find that the gap is mostly limited to incident fluxes {$>$}200 F{\AA}, and its location may be at a slightly larger radius (closer to {$\approx$}2 R{$\oplus$}) when compared to previous results. Furthermore, we find several confirmed exoplanets occupying a previously described ``hot super-Earth desert'' at high irradiance, show the relation between a gas-giant planet's radius and its incident flux, and establish a bona fide sample of eight confirmed planets and 30 planet candidates with Rp {$<$} 2 R{$\oplus$} in circumstellar ``habitable zones'' (incident fluxes between 0.25 and 1.50 F{\AA}).

The volume observed by surveys such as Gaia or near-infrared spectroscopic surveys, which have good coverage of the Galactic midplane region, is highly complex because of the abundant small-scale structure in the three-dimensional interstellar dust extinction. We introduce a novel framework for analyzing the importance of small-scale structure in the extinction. This formalism demonstrates that the spatially complex effect of extinction on the selection function of a pencil-beam or contiguous sky survey is equivalent to a low-pass filtering of the extinction-affected selection function with the smooth density field. We find that the angular resolution of current 3D extinction maps is sufficient for analyzing Gaia sub-samples of millions of stars. However, the current distance resolution is
inadequate and needs to be improved by an order of magnitude, especially in the inner Galaxy. We also present a practical and efficient method for properly taking the effect of extinction into account in analyses of Galactic structure through an effective selection function. We
illustrate its use with the selection function of red-clump stars in APOGEE using and comparing a variety of current 3D extinction maps.},

measuring accurate parameters of detached eclipsing binaries in open

we demonstrated how measurements of multiple eclipsing binaries in the

stellar models than has previously been possible, thereby potentially
improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. Here we
add additional constraints and perform an extensive model comparison to
determine the best estimates of the cluster age and helium content,
employing as many observational constraints as possible. Methods:
We improve our photometry and correct empirically for differential
reddening effects. We then perform an extensive comparison of the new
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and eclipsing binary measurements to
Victoria and DSEP isochrones in order to estimate cluster parameters. We
also reanalyse a spectrum of the star 2-17 to improve [Fe/H]

dominated by uncertainties in the CNO abundances. The helium mass
fraction is well constrained at Y = 0.30{$\pm$}0.01 resulting in
{$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z \textasciitilde{} 1.4 assuming that such a relation exists. During the
analysis we firmly identify blue straggler stars, including the star
2-17, and find indications for the presence of their evolved
counterparts. Our analysis supports the RGB mass-loss found from
asteroseismology and we determine precisely the absolute mass of stars
on the lower RGB, MRGB = 1.15{$\pm$}0.02 M{$\odot$}.
This will be an important consistency check for the detailed
asteroseismology of cluster stars. Conclusions: Using multiple,
detached eclipsing binaries for determining stellar cluster ages, it is
now possible to constrain parameters of stellar models, notably the
helium content, which were previously out of reach. By observing a
suitable number of detached eclipsing binaries in several open clusters,
it will be possible to calibrate the age-scale and the helium enrichment
parameter {$\Delta$} Y/{$\Delta$} Z, and provide firm constraints that stellar
models must reproduce.

data. The large frequency separation is often one of the first outputs
from asteroseismic studies because it can help constrain stellar
properties like mass and radius. We have used three methods for
estimating the large separations: use of individual p-mode frequencies,
computation of the autocorrelation of frequency-power spectra, and
computation of the power spectrum of the power spectrum. The values of
the large separations obtained by the different methods are offset from
each other and have differing sensitivities to the realization noise. A
simple model was used to predict solar-cycle variations in the large
separations, indicating that the variations are due to the well-known
solar-cycle changes to mode frequency. However, this model is only valid
over a restricted frequency range. We discuss the implications of these
results for asteroseismology.},

  abstract = {We use nearby K dwarf stars to measure the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z, a diagnostic of the chemical history of the
solar neighbourhood. Our sample of K dwarfs has homogeneously determined effective temperatures, bolometric luminosities and metallicities, allowing us to fit each star to the appropriate stellar isochrone and determine its helium content indirectly. We use a newly computed set of Padova isochrones which cover a wide range of helium and metal content.

Our theoretical isochrones have been checked against a congruous set of main-sequence binaries with accurately measured masses, to discuss and validate their range of applicability. We find that the stellar masses deduced from the isochrones are usually in excellent agreement with empirical measurements. Good agreement is also found with empirical mass-luminosity relations.

Despite fitting the masses of the stars very well, we find that
anomalously low helium content (lower than primordial helium) is required to fit the luminosities and temperatures of the metal-poor K dwarfs, while more conventional values of the helium content are derived for the stars around solar metallicity.

We have investigated the effect of diffusion in stellar models and the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in deriving
metallicities. Neither of these is able to resolve the low-helium problem alone and only marginally if the cumulated effects are included, unless we assume a mixing-length which is strongly decreasing with metallicity. Further work in stellar models is urgently needed.

The helium-to-metal enrichment ratio is found to be {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z =
2.1 +/- 0.9 around and above solar metallicity, consistent with previous studies, whereas open problems still remain at the lowest metallicities. Finally, we determine the helium content for a set of planetary host stars.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of a group of apparently young CoRoT red-giant stars exhibiting enhanced [{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundance ratios (as determined from APOGEE spectra) with respect to solar values. Their existence is not explained by standard chemical evolution models of the Milky Way, and shows that the chemical-enrichment history of the Galactic disc is more complex. We find similar stars in previously published samples for which isochrone-ages could be reliably obtained, although in smaller relative numbers. This might explain why these stars have not previously received attention. The young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars are much more numerous in the CoRoT-APOGEE (CoRoGEE) inner-field sample than in any other high-resolution sample available at present because only CoRoGEE can explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. The kinematic properties of the young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars are not clearly thick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the Galactic mid-plane. Our tentative interpretation of these and previous intriguing observations in the Milky Way is that these stars were formed close to the end of the Galactic bar, near corotation \textendash{} a region where gas can be kept inert for longer times than in other regions that are more frequently shocked by the passage of spiral arms. Moreover, this is where the mass return from older inner-disc stellar generations is expected to be highest (according to an inside-out disc-formation scenario), which additionally dilutes the in-situ gas. Other possibilities to explain these observations (e.g., a recent gas-accretion event) are also discussed.},

The core of the approach is a Bayesian artificial neural network (ANN) that learns from and completely replaces stellar isochrones. The ANN is trained using a sample of red giant stars with mass estimates from asteroseismology. A Bayesian isochrone pipeline uses the astrometric, photometric, spectroscopic, and asteroseismology data to determine posterior distributions for the training outputs: mass, age, and distance. Given new inputs, posterior predictive distributions for the outputs are computed, taking into account both input uncertainties, and uncertainties in the ANN parameters. We apply MADE to {\~{} \vphantom\{\}10 000 red giants in the overlap between the 14th data release from the APO Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS). The ANN is able to reduce the uncertainty on mass, age, and distance estimates for training-set stars with high output uncertainties allocated through the Bayesian isochrone pipeline. The fractional uncertainties on mass are \&lt; 10 per cent and on age are between 10 to 25 per cent. Moreover, the time taken for our ANN to predict masses, ages, and distances for the entire catalogue of APOGEE-TGAS stars is of a similar order of the time taken by the Bayesian isochrone pipeline to run on a handful of stars. Our resulting catalogue clearly demonstrates the expected thick- and thin-disc components in the [M/H]-[{$\alpha$}/M] plane, when examined by age.},

We identify modes of oscillation and estimate mode frequencies by `peak bagging' using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework. In addition, we expand the methodology of quality assurance using a Bayesian unsupervised machine learning approach. We report the measured frequencies of the modes of oscillation for all 35 stars and frequency ratios commonly used in detailed asteroseismic modelling. Due to the high correlations associated with frequency ratios we report the covariance matrix of all frequencies measured and frequency ratios calculated. These frequencies, frequency ratios, and covariance matrices can be used to obtain tight constraint on the fundamental parameters of these planet-hosting stars.},

We discuss how the high precision in these parameters will constrain the stellar properties of stellar radius, distance, mass and age. We show that high precision can be achieved in mass and hence age when values of the g-mode period spacing are available.

  abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the
scientific community focusses on data processing for which the
international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and
subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built
spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.

  abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey.
Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the
first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data
Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second
data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1
in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data
products. Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the
apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3
billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition
available. The sample of sources for which variability information is
provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains
four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the
apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and
GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources;
median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for
between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar
effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity;
and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system
epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also
represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the
optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based
solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the
photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia
DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as
independent. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement
for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide
parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing
a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and
source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia
survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our
galaxy.},

These tools are built on the Python requests package, which is used to make HTTP requests, and astropy, which provides most of the data parsing functionality. astroquery modules generally attempt to replicate the web page interface provided by a given service as closely as possible, making the transition from browser-based to command-line interaction easy. astroquery has received significant contributions from throughout the astronomical community, including several from telescope archives. astroquery enables the creation of fully reproducible
workflows from data acquisition through publication. This paper
describes the philosophy, basic structure, and development model of the astroquery package. The complete documentation for astroquery can be

The high quality of the collected seismic data and the subsequent theoretical work for interpreting them brought up a series of issues which revealed that our knowledge of the internal properties of red giant stars remains quite limited. Two such important issues are discussed here, namely mixing beyond the convective core of helium burning red giant stars and evolution of internal angular momentum for post main sequence stars. This includes how they were diagnosed and what are the resulting improvements in our understanding regarding these issues (or rather how far we are from a proper understanding and realistic modelling of the structure and evolution of post main sequence stars).},

a few kiloparsecs. This new map contains three major improvements over our previous work. First, the inclusion of Gaia parallaxes dramatically improves distance estimates to nearby stars. Second, we incorporate a spatial prior that correlates the dust density across nearby sightlines. This produces a smoother map, with more isotropic clouds and smaller distance uncertainties, particularly to clouds within the nearest kiloparsec. Third, we infer the dust density with a distance resolution that is four times finer than in our previous work, to accommodate the improvements in signal-to-noise enabled by the other improvements. As part of this work, we infer the distances, reddenings, and types of 799 million stars. (Our 3D dust map can be accessed at doi:10.7910/DVN/2EJ9TX or through the Python package dustmaps, while our catalog of stellar parameters can be accessed at doi:10.7910/DVN/AV9GXO.

  abstract = {Asteroseismology provides fundamental stellar parameters independent of distance, but subject to systematics under calibration. Gaia DR2 has provided parallaxes for a billion stars, which are offset by a parallax zero-point ({$\varpi$}zp). Red Clump (RC) stars have a narrow
spread in luminosity, thus functioning as standard candles to calibrate these systematics. This work measures how the magnitude and spread of the RC in the Kepler field are affected by changes to temperature and scaling relations for seismology, and changes to the parallax zero-point for Gaia. We use a sample of 5576 RC stars classified through
asteroseismology. We apply hierarchical Bayesian latent variable models, finding the population-level properties of the RC with seismology, and use those as priors on Gaia parallaxes to find {$\varpi$}zp. We then find the position of the RC, using published values for
{$\varpi$}zp. We find a seismic temperature-insensitive spread of the RC of \{{$\sim$} \}0.03 mag in the 2MASS K band and a larger and slightly temperature-dependent spread of \{{$\sim$} \}0.13 mag in the Gaia G band. This intrinsic dispersion in the K band provides a distance precision of \{{$\sim$} \} 1\{\{ per cent\}\} for RC stars. Using Gaia data alone, we find a mean zero-point of -41{$\pm$} 10 {$\mu$} as. This offset yields RC
absolute magnitudes of -1.634 {$\pm$} 0.018 in K and 0.546 {$\pm$}
0.016 in G. Obtaining these same values through seismology would require a global temperature shift of \{{$\sim$} \}-70 K, which is compatible with known systematics in spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Context. The length of the asteroseismic timeseries obtained from the 
Kepler satellite analysed here span 19 months. Kepler provides the
longest continuous timeseries currently available, which calls for a
study of the influence of the increased timespan on the accuracy and
precision of the obtained results. Aims: We aim to investigate
how the increased timespan influences the detectability of the
oscillation modes, and the absolute values and uncertainties of the
global oscillation parameters, i.e., frequency of maximum oscillation
power, {$\nu$}max, and large frequency separation between modes
of the same degree and consecutive orders, {$\langle$} {$\Delta\nu$} {$\rangle$} .
 Methods: We use published methods to derive {$\nu$}max
and {$\langle$} {$\Delta\nu$} {$\rangle$} for timeseries ranging from 50 to 600 days
and compare these results as a function of method, timespan and {$\langle$}
{$\Delta\nu$} {$\rangle$} . Results: We find that in general a minimum
of the order of 400 day long timeseries are necessary to obtain reliable
results for the global oscillation parameters in more than 95\% of the
stars, but this does depend on {$\langle$} {$\Delta\nu$} {$\rangle$} . In a
statistical sense the quoted uncertainties seem to provide a reasonable
indication of the precision of the obtained results in short (50-day)
runs, they do however seem to be overestimated for results of longer
runs. Furthermore, the different definitions of the global parameters
used in the different methods have non-negligible effects on the
obtained values. Additionally, we show that there is a correlation
between {$\nu$}max and the flux variance. Conclusions: We
conclude that longer timeseries improve the likelihood to detect
oscillations with automated codes (from \textasciitilde{}60\% in 50 day runs to {$>$}95\%
in 400 day runs with a slight method dependence) and the precision of
the obtained global oscillation parameters. The trends suggest that the
improvement will continue for even longer timeseries than the 600 days
considered here, with a reduction in the median absolute deviation of
more than a factor of 10 for an increase in timespan from 50 to 2000
days (the currently foreseen length of the mission). This work shows
that global parameters determined with high precision - thus from long
datasets - using different definitions can be used to identify the
evolutionary state of the stars.

  abstract = {Time-resolved photometry of tens of thousands of red giant stars from space missions like Kepler and K2 has created the need for automated asteroseismic analysis methods. The first and most fundamental step in such analysis is to identify which stars show oscillations. It is critical that this step be performed with no, or little, detection bias, particularly when performing subsequent ensemble analyses that aim to compare the properties of observed stellar populations with those from galactic models. However, an efficient, automated solution to this initial detection step still has not been found, meaning that expert visual inspection of data from each star is required to obtain the highest level of detections. Hence, to mimic how an expert eye analyzes the data, we use supervised deep learning to not only detect oscillations in red giants, but also to predict the location of the frequency at maximum power, {$\nu$}max, by observing features in 2D images of power spectra. By training on Kepler data, we benchmark our deep-learning classifier against K2 data that are given detections by the expert eye, achieving a detection accuracy of 98\% on K2 Campaign 6 stars and a detection accuracy of 99\% on K2 Campaign 3 stars. We further find that the estimated uncertainty of our deep-learning-based {$\nu$}max predictions is about 5\%. This is comparable to human-level performance using visual inspection. When examining outliers, we find that the deep-learning results are more likely to provide robust {$\nu$}max estimates than the classical model-fitting method.},

separation ({$\Delta\nu$}), and oscillation amplitudes. We show that the
difference of the {$\Delta\nu$}-{$\nu$}max relation for unevolved
and evolved stars can be explained by different distributions in
effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with what is
expected from scaling relations. For oscillation amplitudes, we show
that neither (L/M) s scaling nor the revised scaling
relation by Kjeldsen \& Bedding is accurate for red-giant stars, and
demonstrate that a revised scaling relation with a separate
luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculate amplitudes from the
main sequence to red giants to a precision of \textasciitilde{}25\%. The residuals show
an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that an
additional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the
observed amplitudes. We investigate correlations between amplitudes and
stellar activity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude
suppression is most pronounced for subgiant stars. Finally, we test the
location of the cool edge of the instability strip in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram using solar-like oscillations and find the
detections in the hottest stars compatible with a domain of hybrid

Primarily designed to detect planetary transits and asteroseismological signals from solar-like stars, Kepler has provided high-quality data for many areas of investigation. Unconditioned simple aperture time-series photometry is, however, affected by systematic structure. Examples of these systematics include differential velocity aberration, thermal gradients across the spacecraft, and pointing variations. While
exhibiting some impact on Kepler's primary science, these
systematics can critically handicap potentially ground-breaking
scientific gains in other astrophysical areas, especially over long timescales greater than 10 days. As the data archive grows to provide light curves for 105 stars of many years in length, Kepler will only fulfill its broad potential for stellar astrophysics if these systematics are understood and mitigated. Post-launch developments in the Kepler archive, data reduction pipeline and open source data analysis software have helped to remove or reduce systematic artifacts. This paper provides a conceptual primer to help users of the Kepler data archive understand and recognize systematic artifacts within light curves and some methods for their removal. Specific examples of artifact mitigation are provided using data available within the archive. Through the methods defined here, the Kepler community will find a road map to maximizing the quality and employment of the Kepler legacy archive.},

  abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase. Aims: We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task. Methods: Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion. Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G {$<$} 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding
uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr-1,
respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr-1. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr-1 in proper motion are seen on small ({$<$} 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.},

  abstract = {Aims: We investigate the relation between 1D atmosphere models 
that rely on the mixing length theory and models based on full 3D
radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) calculations to describe convection in the
envelopes of late-type stars. Methods: The adiabatic entropy
value of the deep convection zone, sbot, and the entropy
jump, {$\Delta$}s, determined from the 3D RHD models, were matched with the
mixing length parameter, {$\alpha$}MLT, from 1D hydrostatic
atmosphere models with identical microphysics (opacities and
equation-of-state). We also derived the mass mixing length parameter,
{$\alpha$}m, and the vertical correlation length of the vertical
velocity, C[vz,vz], directly from the 3D
hydrodynamical simulations of stellar subsurface convection. 
Results: The calibrated mixing length parameter for the Sun is
{$\alpha$}๏MLT (Sbot) = 1.98. . For
different stellar parameters, {$\alpha$}MLT varies
systematically in the range of 1.7 - 2.4. In particular,
{$\alpha$}MLT decreases towards higher effective temperature,
lower surface gravity and higher metallicity. We find equivalent results
for {$\alpha$}๏MLT ({$\Delta$}S). In addition, we
find a tight correlation between the mixing length parameter and the
inverse entropy jump. We derive an analytical expression from the
hydrodynamic mean-field equations that motivates the relation to the
mass mixing length parameter, {$\alpha$}m, and find that it
qualitatively shows a similar variation with stellar parameter (between
1.6 and 2.4) with the solar value of
{$\alpha$}๏m = 1.83.. The vertical correlation
length scaled with the pressure scale height yields 1.71 for the Sun,
but only displays a small systematic variation with stellar parameters,
the correlation length slightly increases with Teff. 
Conclusions: We derive mixing length parameters for various stellar
parameters that can be used to replace a constant value. Within any
convective envelope, {$\alpha$}m and related quantities vary
strongly. Our results will help to replace a constant
{$\alpha$}MLT.

  abstract = {Context. Asteroseismology allows us to probe the physical conditions 
inside the core of red giant stars. This process relies on the
properties of the global oscillations with a mixed character that are
highly sensitive to the physical properties of the core. However,
overlapping rotational splittings and mixed-mode spacings result in
complex structures in the mixed-mode pattern, which severely complicates
its identification and the measurement of the asymptotic period spacing.
 Aims: This work aims at disentangling the rotational splittings
from the mixed-mode spacings in order to open the way to a fully
automated analysis of large data sets. Methods: An analytical
development of the mixed-mode asymptotic expansion is used to derive the
period spacing between two consecutive mixed modes. The {\'e}chelle
diagrams constructed with the appropriately stretched periods are used
to exhibit the structure of the gravity modes and of the rotational
splittings. Results: We propose a new view of the mixed-mode
oscillation pattern based on corrected periods, called stretched
periods, that mimic the evenly spaced gravity-mode pattern. This
provides a direct understanding of all oscillation components, even in
the case of rapid rotation. In this way, the measurement of the
asymptotic period spacing and the signature of the structural glitches
on mixed modes can be performed easily. Conclusions: This work
makes it possible to derive all seismic global parameters in an
automated way, including the identification of the different rotational
multiplets and the measurement of the rotational splitting, even when
this splitting is significantly larger than the period spacing.
Revealing buoyancy glitches provides a detailed view of the radiative

for numerous solar-type stars and red giants are either currently
available, e.g. courtesy of the CoRoT, Kepler, and K2 missions, or will
become available with the upcoming NASA TESS and ESA PLATO 2.0 missions.
The data can lead to a precise characterisation of these stars thereby
improving our understanding of stellar evolution, exoplanetary systems,
and the history of our galaxy. Aims: Our goal is to test and
compare different methods for obtaining stellar properties from
oscillation frequencies and spectroscopic constraints. Specifically, we
would like to evaluate the accuracy of the results and reliability of
the associated error bars, and to see where there is room for
improvement. Methods: In the context of the SpaceInn network, we
carried out a hare-and-hounds exercise in which one group, the hares,
simulated observations of oscillation spectra for a set of ten
artificial solar-type stars, and a number of hounds applied various
methods for characterising these stars based on the data produced by the
hares. Most of the hounds fell into two main groups. The first group
used forward modelling (I.e. applied various search/optimisation
algorithms in a stellar parameter space) whereas the second group relied
on acoustic glitch signatures. Results: Results based on the
forward modelling approach were accurate to 1.5\% (radius), 3.9\% (mass),
23\% (age), 1.5\% (surface gravity), and 1.8\% (mean density), as based on
the root mean square difference. Individual hounds reached different
degrees of accuracy, some of which were substantially better than the
above average values. For the two 1M{$\odot$} stellar targets,
the accuracy on the age is better than 10\% thereby satisfying the
requirements for the PLATO 2.0 mission. High stellar masses and atomic
diffusion (which in our models does not include the effects of radiative
accelerations) proved to be sources of difficulty. The average
accuracies for the acoustic radii of the base of the convection zone,
the He II ionisation, and the {$\Gamma$}1 peak located between
the two He ionisation zones were 17\%, 2.4\%, and 1.9\%, respectively. The
results from the forward modelling were on average more accurate than
those from the glitch fitting analysis as the latter seemed to be
affected by aliasing problems for some of the targets. 
Conclusions: Our study indicates that forward modelling is the most
accurate way of interpreting the pulsation spectra of solar-type stars.
However, given its model-dependent nature, this method needs to be
complemented by model-independent results from, e.g. glitch analysis.
Furthermore, our results indicate that global rather than local
optimisation algorithms should be used in order to obtain robust error
bars.},

We use these dependencies to determine the correlation between Y ini and Y surf and use this correlation to eliminate uncertainties in Y ini from all solar model input parameters except the microscopic diffusion rate. We find an expression for Y ini that depends only on Y surf and the diffusion rate. By adopting the helioseismic determination of solar surface helium abundance, Y surf sun = 0.2485 {$\pm$} 0.0035, and an uncertainty of 20\% for the diffusion
rate, we find that the initial solar helium abundance, Y ini sun, is 0.278 {$\pm$} 0.006 independently of the reference
SSMs (and particularly on the adopted solar abundances) used in the derivation of the correlation between Y ini and Y
surf. When non-SSMs with extra mixing are used, then we derive Y ini sun = 0.273 {$\pm$} 0.006. In both

Asteroseismic data for our sample of 415 objects have been obtained by the Kepler mission in short (58.5 s) cadence, and light curves span from 30 up to more than 1000 days. The spectroscopic parameters are based on spectra taken as part of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and correspond to Data Release 13 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We analyze our data using two independent \{T\}\{eff\} scales, the spectroscopic values from DR13 and those derived from SDSS griz photometry. We use the differences in our results arising from these choices as a test of systematic temperature uncertainties and find that they can lead to significant differences in the derived stellar properties.
Determinations of surface gravity (\{log\}g), mean density ({$<$} {$\rho$}
{$>$} ), radius (R), mass (M), and age ({$\tau$}) for the whole sample have been carried out by means of (stellar) grid-based modeling. We have thoroughly assessed random and systematic error sources in the
spectroscopic and asteroseismic data, as well as in the grid-based modeling determination of the stellar quantities provided in the catalog. We provide stellar properties determined for each of the two \{T\}\{eff\} scales. The median combined (random and systematic) uncertainties are 2\% (0.01 dex; \{log\}g), 3.4\% ({$<$} {$\rho$} {$>$} ), 2.6\%

determining stellar parameters accurately. Finally, we compare our results with those coming from a variety of sources, including stellar radii determined from TGAS parallaxes and asteroseismic analyses based on individual frequencies.

We implement a new Bayesian scheme that is flexible in its input to process individual oscillation frequencies, combinations of them, and average asteroseismic parameters, and derive robust fundamental properties for these targets. Applying this scheme to grids of evolutionary models yields stellar properties with median statistical uncertainties of 1.2 per cent (radius), 1.7 per cent (density), 3.3 per cent (mass), 4.4 per cent (distance), and 14 per cent (age), making this the exoplanet host-star sample with the most precise and uniformly determined fundamental parameters to date. We assess the systematics from changes in the solar abundances and mixing-length parameter, showing that they are smaller than the statistical errors. We also determine the stellar properties with three other fitting algorithms and explore the systematics arising from using different evolution and pulsation codes, resulting in 1 per cent in density and radius, and 2 per cent and 7 per cent in mass and age, respectively. We confirm previous findings of the initial helium abundance being a source of systematics comparable to our statistical uncertainties, and discuss future prospects for constraining this parameter by combining asteroseismology and data from space missions. Finally, we compare our derived properties with those obtained using the global average asteroseismic observables along with effective temperature and metallicity, finding excellent level of agreement.

  abstract = {We use asteroseismic data from the Kepler satellite to determine 
fundamental stellar properties of the 66 main-sequence targets observed
for at least one full year by the mission. We distributed tens of
individual oscillation frequencies extracted from the time series of
each star among seven modeling teams who applied different methods to
determine radii, masses, and ages for all stars in the sample.
Comparisons among the different results reveal a good level of agreement
in all stellar properties, which is remarkable considering the variety
of codes, input physics, and analysis methods employed by the different
teams. Average uncertainties are of the order of \texttildelow{}2\% in radius,
\texttildelow{}4\% in mass, and \texttildelow{}10\% in age, making this the best-characterized
sample of main-sequence stars available to date. Our predicted initial
abundances and mixing-length parameters are checked against inferences
from chemical enrichment laws {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z and predictions from 3D
atmospheric simulations. We test the accuracy of the determined stellar
properties by comparing them to the Sun, angular diameter measurements,
Gaia parallaxes, and binary evolution, finding excellent agreement in
all cases and further confirming the robustness of asteroseismically
determined physical parameters of stars when individual frequencies of
oscillation are available. Baptised as the Kepler dwarfs LEGACY sample,
these stars are the solar-like oscillators with the best asteroseismic
properties available for at least another decade. All data used in this
analysis and the resulting stellar parameters are made publicly
available for the community.},

  abstract = {With the unprecedented photometric precision of the Kepler spacecraft, 
significant systematic and stochastic errors on transit signal levels
are observable in the Kepler photometric data. These errors, which
include discontinuities, outliers, systematic trends, and other
instrumental signatures, obscure astrophysical signals. The presearch
data conditioning (PDC) module of the Kepler data analysis pipeline
tries to remove these errors while preserving planet transits and other
astrophysically interesting signals. The completely new noise and
stellar variability regime observed in Kepler data poses a significant
problem to standard cotrending methods. Variable stars are often of
particular astrophysical interest, so the preservation of their signals
is of significant importance to the astrophysical community. We present
a Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach, where a subset of highly
correlated and quiet stars is used to generate a cotrending basis vector
set, which is in turn used to establish a range of
``reasonable'' robust fit parameters. These robust fit
parameters are then used to generate a Bayesian prior and a Bayesian
posterior probability distribution function (PDF) which, when maximized,
finds the best fit that simultaneously removes systematic effects while
reducing the signal distortion and noise injection that commonly
afflicts simple least-squares (LS) fitting. A numerical and empirical
approach is taken where the Bayesian prior PDFs are generated from fits
to the light-curve distributions themselves.},

This review presents a summary of the available techniques for age-dating stars and ensembles of stars, their realms of applicability, and their strengths and weaknesses. My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve when stressed by better observations.},

For low rod concentrations \$\textbackslash{}Phi\_r\$ we observe a direct phase transition, as bead concentration \$\textbackslash{}Phi\_b\$ is increased, from the isotropic phase to a homogeneous flock. For \$\textbackslash{}Phi\_r\$ above a threshold value, an ordered band dense in both rods and beads occurs between the disordered phase and the homogeneous flock, in both experiments and simulations. Within the size ranges accessible we observe only a single band, whose width increases with \$\textbackslash{}Phi\_r\$. Deep in the ordered state, we observe broken-symmetry "sound" modes and giant number fluctuations. The direction-dependent sound speeds and the scaling of fluctuations are consistent with the predictions of field theories of flocking, but sound damping rates show departures from such theories. At very high densities we see phase separation into rod-rich and bead-rich regions, both of which move coherently.},

  abstract = {Kepler provides light curves of 156,000 stars with unprecedented 
precision. However, the raw data as they come from the spacecraft
contain significant systematic and stochastic errors. These errors,
which include discontinuities, systematic trends, and outliers, obscure
the astrophysical signals in the light curves. To correct these errors
is the task of the Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC) module of the
Kepler data analysis pipeline. The original version of PDC in Kepler did
not meet the extremely high performance requirements for the detection
of miniscule planet transits or highly accurate analysis of stellar
activity and rotation. One particular deficiency was that astrophysical
features were often removed as a side effect of the removal of errors.
In this article we introduce the completely new and significantly
improved version of PDC which was implemented in Kepler SOC version 8.0.
This new PDC version, which utilizes a Bayesian approach for removal of
systematics, reliably corrects errors in the light curves while at the
same time preserving planet transits and other astrophysically
interesting signals. We describe the architecture and the algorithms of
this new PDC module, show typical errors encountered in Kepler data, and
illustrate the corrections using real light curve examples.},

warmest dwarf, which is just cool enough to admit a convective envelope,
and up to 2.05 for the coolest dwarfs in our grid. In between these is a
triangular plateau of {$\alpha$} {$\sim$} 1.76. The Sun is located on this
plateau and has seen little change during its evolution so far. When
stars ascend the giant branch, they largely do so along tracks of
constant {$\alpha$}, with {$\alpha$} decreasing with increasing mass.},

The advantages our technique has over traditional analyses of color-magnitude diagrams are objectivity, precision, and explicit dependence on prior knowledge of cluster parameters. Within the confines of a given set of often-used models of stellar evolution, a single mapping of initial to final masses, and white dwarf cooling, and assuming photometric errors that one could reasonably achieve with the Hubble Space Telescope, our technique yields exceptional precision for even modest numbers of cluster stars. For clusters with 50\textendash{}400 members and one to a few dozen white dwarfs, we find typical internal errors of  ({$\frac{1}{2}$}Fe/ H ) 0:03 dex,  (m {\`A} MV ) 0:02 mag, and  (AV ) 0:01 mag. We derive cluster white dwarf ages with internal errors of typically only 10\% for clusters with only three white dwarfs and almost always 5\% with 10 white dwarfs. These exceptional precisions will allow us to test white dwarf cooling models and standard stellar evolution models through observations of white dwarfs in open and globular clusters.},

A common pattern of oscillation frequency was observed in red giant stars, which corresponds to the second-order development of the asymptotic theory. This pattern, called the universal red giant oscillation pattern, describes the frequencies of stellar acoustic modes. We aim to investigate the deviations observed from this universal pattern, thereby characterizing them in terms of the location of the second ionization zone of helium.

scales may be distinguished from errors in the Gaia parallax scale. We
estimate systematic effects on the inferred global Gaia parallax offset,
c, due to radius and temperature systematics, as well as choices in
bolometric correction and the adopted form for Gaia parallax spatial
correlations. Because of possible spatially correlated parallax errors,
as discussed by the Gaia team, our Gaia parallax offset model is
specific to the Kepler field, but broadly compatible with the magnitude-
